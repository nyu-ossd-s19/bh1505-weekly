## Blog about what you found the most interesting and the most surprising in the talk given by Kevin Fleming in class

What I found to be most interesting and most surprising was when Kevin mentioned that there are companies who hire people to work on open source projects full-time and that sometimes these projects aren’t even being used by the companies themselves. The fact that people are being paid to help the open source community and not necessarily their employers’ own needs goes to show how important and prevalent open source software has become. It’s nice to know that companies aren’t only invested in getting ahead of their competition, but also in promoting collaboration and helping the tech world grow as a whole.

## Blog about your personal progress towards the team project: what have you done, what did you learn, what are the tasks that you will be working on next week

This week I learned more about TypeScript and submitted another [pull request](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/15408) to add TypeScript demos for several of Material-UI’s Selection-Controls components. As of now, my changes have been approved by the maintainers, but they have not been merged yet. I also added more Spanish translations for the Material-UI website. For next week I will continue adding any missing TypeScript demos as well as more translations to the documentation.
