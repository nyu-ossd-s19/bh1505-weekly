# Open Source

## What do YOU think about when you hear the term "open source"?
When I hear the term "open source" I think of collaboration and teamwork towards one shared goal. All are invited to 
help reach this goal so long as they contribute appropriately.

## What are some advantages of open vs. closed source?
Making a project open source provides a quick and easy way for your work to be evaluated by many people, providing an abundance of constructive criticism. Open source is also good for large projects that require team effort. Moreover, open source can help employers recruit talent, specifically contributors to their projects.

## What are some potential problems with open source?
It may be difficult to agree as a group on certain aspects or new ideas for the project. Open source can also make your project vulnerable to attacks and stealing.

## Why did you decide to register for a class about open source software development?
I registered for this class to learn how to effectively contribute to open source projects and to gain experience in team-based software development. I also hope to get better at communicating with others about code and new ideas.
