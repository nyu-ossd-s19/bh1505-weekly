## Using Open Source Software in Projects for Social Good

I believe that open source software is a great way to help others and key to promoting humanitarianism as its principles are similar to that of volunteerism in general. Open source software is all about working together as a team with a can-do attitude and no strings attached, providing the perfect environment for success in humanitarian efforts. By keeping these projects open, their impact can spread rapidly and adjustments can be made to cater to other problems at hand. Open source software deserves its place in social good because its shareability makes it easier to help as many people as possible. 

### Do you think such projects are easier or harder to get involved with?

These projects are probably easier to get involved with because of the ever-growing need for volunteers and an active community. When people's lives are on the line, there is no room for error. Thus, potential issues or improvements in the code or documentation are probably given more attention and quicker responses than regular projects. However, the variability of the needs of a people requires contributors to be more in touch with the goals of the cause and the immediate, local consequences of a disaster, for example. 

### Do you think involvement in such projects bring more or less prestige to the contributor (compared to other projects)?

I don't think that involvement in such projects should be about how much prestige it brings. Of course, contributing to one of them showcases one's coding skills, but the motivation behind one's contribution should be about helping others. Since some of these projects do in fact save the lives of many, there may be more appreciation and gratitude for the release and improvement of such a software, but we can not forget about other non-humantarian open source tools that allow for these HFOSS projects to even exist. 

### Would you want to be involved in a project like that?

I would love to get involved in a project like this and try to help as many people as possible. It would feel great knowing that my efforts in learning how to code and develop software actually saved people or simply made their lives better.
