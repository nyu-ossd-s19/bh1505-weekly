## Using Open Source Software in Projects for Social Good

I believe that open source software is a great way to help others and key to promoting humanitarianism as its principles are similar to that of volunteerism in general. Open source software is all about working together as a team with a can-do attitude and no strings attached, providing the perfect environment for success in humanitarian efforts. By keeping these projects open, their impact can spread rapidly and adjustments can be made to cater to other problems at hand. Open source software deserves its place in social good because its shareability makes it easier to help as many people as possible. 

### Do you think such projects are easier or harder to get involved with?

These projects are probably easier to get involved with because of the ever-growing need for volunteers and an active community. When people's lives are on the line, there is no room for error. Thus, potential issues or improvements in the code or documentation are probably given more attention and quicker responses than regular projects. However, the variability of the needs of a people requires contributors to be more in touch with the goals of the cause and the immediate, local consequences of a disaster, for example.
