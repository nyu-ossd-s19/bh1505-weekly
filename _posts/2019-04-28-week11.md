## Summary of my contributions to the group project:

This week I submitted two more pull requests and they were both merged. The [first one](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/15478) involved adding a JavaScript demo for a new component called Customized Slider. For the [second one](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/15493) I added TypeScript demos for the Nested List and Switch List Secondary componenets.
