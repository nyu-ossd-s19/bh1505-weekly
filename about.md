My name is Brandon Herrera, I'm a Senior at NYU and I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. I intend to pursue
a career in building software and would love to some time down the line find a career that can incorporate the two.

### More Information

I'm from Miami, Florida and I love Artichoke Pizza.
